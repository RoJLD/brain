# Changelog — brain

The command shares the repo's tag series with `research-graph`: `vX.Y.Z` is both at X.Y.Z.

## 0.2.0 — 2026-11-03

The brain command, published as this repo's second distribution, from the personal brain it was written in (a fresh
history: its code, Claude hooks, tests and installer at their targets, then the changes below).

- **The digest dates closures at any hour.** `digest.git_closures` bounds `git log` by full days at midnight and keeps
  the commits whose own day falls in the window: a bare `--since=<day>` was read at the current time of day, so a
  closure from the first day of margin showed up or not depending on the hour (failing before noon UTC).
- **Python 3.10 reads pyproject.toml.** The `tomli` backport is a dependency below 3.11, and `brain.inventory` falls
  back to it: the audit, the scout and the links measured nothing on 3.10 without `tomllib`.
- **A package of its own.** `packages/brain`: `pip install "brain @ git+https://github.com/RoJLD/brain.git@v0.2.0#subdirectory=packages/brain"`;
  it depends on `research-graph` at the same tag. The Claude hooks are package data
  (`src/brain/adapters/claude/hooks/`), copied into the owner's own plugin by `brain render --target claude`; the
  engine's narrow allow rules too (`src/brain/adapters/claude/allow-rules.txt`, read by `brain permissions`).
- **The personal brain, found from anywhere.** `$BRAIN_PERSONAL`, then the machine's pointer
  `<BRAIN_HOME>/personal.json` (`{"root": ...}`), join the places `config.json`, `projects.yaml` and `permissions.yaml`
  are looked for (after `$CLAUDE_BRAIN_DIR`; the pointer after the repo acted on, so a worktree reads its own files),
  and the repo acted on falls back to the personal brain (`brain.paths.bases`, `personal_root`). `inject-rules.sh`
  reads the pointer too; `brain config` shows it.
- **The hooks find the installed engine.** Every hook's launcher tries `$BRAIN_PYTHON`, then the brain command's venv
  (`<BRAIN_HOME>/venv`), then `python3` and `python`: a plugin folder without the package runs the installed one.
- **`brain init`**: a new personal brain from `src/brain/templates/` (config.json v1 with the engine pinned at this
  tag and the Lite tier, projects.yaml, the graph store by `research_graph init --owner`, journal, ADR log, neutral
  starter rules, CLAUDE.md, memory and records) and the machine's pointer; a plan, `--apply` writes it, nothing is
  overwritten.
- **The installer** (`installer/install.ps1`) installs the command at the tag config.json `engine.pin` names (or its
  own version without a personal brain; `-Engine` for another pip spec), takes the personal brain from `-Personal`
  (its main checkout, never a worktree), writes the pointer, and runs the Claude steps only when config.json names a
  marketplace and rules.
- **`brain check --public --history`** also reads the commits' messages (every check of a line) and their author's
  and committer's e-mail addresses (a no-reply one passes).
- Tests: the ones that read the personal brain's own files stay there; the permission tests read a neutral fixture
  (`tests/fixtures/permissions.yaml`).
